## Features
|Feature|Description|
|:--:|:--:|
|Navbar Cover|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/173740659-2f7f1054-5a82-45bf-9105-ba52485f7a37.gif" width="400" height="400"><br>When you click any of the buttons on the cover page, the cover page shrinks to the top, revealing the website content.|
|Text Background Sliding|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/173740872-178e8478-a30f-40fb-b887-c174149ce0f1.gif" width="400" height="400"><br>When you click the button, the text related to that section appears with an animation effect.|
|One-page Website|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/173741327-9b336183-e69a-4086-b26b-6d967e8fc244.gif" width="400" height="300"><br>This is my personal challenge in this project, the 'sideways-page website' feature. There are two 100% width pages, the current page moves to ```left: -100%``` and the new page moves from ```left: 100%``` to ```left: 0%```.|
|Scroll Events|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/173741723-90b1c4ac-0b0e-4a6e-9f6b-ce0bded8430e.gif" width="400" height="300"><br>When the user scrolls to reach the section, the scroll event is triggered.|
|Selecting Items|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/173741959-61439c08-e843-483b-8a07-f7ad421a0b9c.gif" width="400" height="300"><br>I've implemented a feature where clicking on the menu advances to the next one to enhance the user experience. In the end, it calculates the total price based on the menus the user has chosen.|

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/SunilPark1129/icecream-day
```

## That can be improved
- I need to make the class names more efficient so that they are more visually organized, easier to understand and easier to see.
- I need to learn how to create a project that fetches items using the API rather than calling an item that was created directly in local.
- I need to create a project using other open source JavaScript framework.
